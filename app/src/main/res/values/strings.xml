    <!--FAQ STUNTING-->
    <string name="expand1">What is Stunting ?</string>
    <string name="faq1">Stunting is a condition of failure to thrive in children under five years of age (toddlers) due to chronic lack of nutritional intake and recurrent infections, especially during the First 1,000 Days of Life (HPK), namely from the fetus to the child aged 23 months. Stunting is determined by an anthropometric index that uses body length data based on age (PB/U) for children under 2 years of age and uses height based on age data (TB/U) for children aged 2 years and over.</string>
