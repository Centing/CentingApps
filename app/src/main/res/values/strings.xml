    <!--FAQ STUNTING-->
    <string name="expand1">What is Stunting ?</string>
    <string name="faq1">Stunting is a condition of failure to thrive in children under five years of age (toddlers) due to chronic lack of nutritional intake and recurrent infections, especially during the First 1,000 Days of Life (HPK), namely from the fetus to the child aged 23 months. Stunting is determined by an anthropometric index that uses body length data based on age (PB/U) for children under 2 years of age and uses height based on age data (TB/U) for children aged 2 years and over.</string>

    <string name="faq2">- Growth slows down, Face looks younger than children his age, Delayed tooth growth, Poor performance in focus ability and learning memory, Age 8-10 years children become quieter , dont make much eye contact with people around them, The toddlers weight does not increase and even tends to decrease, The childs body development is hampered, such as late menarche (a girls first menstruation). The child is easily attacked by various infectious diseases. </string>

    <string name="expand3">What are the impacts of stunting?</string>
    <string name="faq3">There are many losses that children experience if they experience stunting. The short-term impacts of stunting on children aged 0-5 are: (1) The child gets sick easily, (2) The childs growth and development is hampered, for example the child is late in talking or walking.
